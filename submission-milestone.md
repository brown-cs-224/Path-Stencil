## Path (final)

Please fill this out and submit your work to Gradescope by the deadline.

### Output Comparison
Run the program with the specified `.ini` config file to compare your output against the reference images. The program should automatically save to the correct path for the images to appear in the table below.

If you aren't using the Qt framework, you may also produce your outputs otherwise so long as you place them in the correct directories as specified in the table.

> Qt Creator users: If your program can't find certain files or you aren't seeing your output images appear, make sure to:<br/>
> 1. Set your working directory to the project directory
> 2. Set the command-line argument in Qt Creator to `template_inis/milestone/<ini_file_name>.ini`

Note that your outputs do **not** need to exactly match the reference outputs. There are several factors that may result in minor differences, such as your choice of tone mapping and randomness.



Please do not attempt to duplicate the given reference images; we have tools to detect this.

| `.ini` File To Produce Output | Expected Output | Your Output |
| :---------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
| cornell_box_milestone.ini |  ![](example-scenes/ground_truth/milestone/cornell_box_milestone.png) | ![Place cornell_box_milestone.png in student_outputs/required folder](student_outputs/milestone/cornell_box_milestone.png) |
| sphere_milestone.ini | ![](example-scenes/ground_truth/milestone/sphere_milestone.png) | ![Place sphere_milestone.png in student_outputs/intersect/required folder](student_outputs/milestone/sphere_milestone.png) |
