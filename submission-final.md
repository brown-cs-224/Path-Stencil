## Path (final submission)

Please fill this out and submit your work to Gradescope by the deadline.

### Output Comparison
Run the program with the specified `.ini` config file to compare your output against the reference images. The program should automatically save to the correct path for the images to appear in the table below.

If you are not using the Qt framework, you may also produce your outputs otherwise so long as you place them in the correct directories as specified in the table. In this case, please also describe how your code can be run to reproduce your outputs

> Qt Creator users: If your program can't find certain files or you aren't seeing your output images appear, make sure to:<br/>
> 1. Set your working directory to the project directory
> 2. Set the command-line argument in Qt Creator to `template_inis/final/<ini_file_name>.ini`

Note that your outputs do **not** need to exactly match the reference outputs. There are several factors that may result in minor differences, such as your choice of tone mapping and randomness.



Please do not attempt to duplicate the given reference images; we have tools to detect this.

| `.ini` File To Produce Output | Expected Output | Your Output |
| :---------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
| cornell_box_full_lighting.ini |  ![](example-scenes/ground_truth/final/cornell_box_full_lighting.png) | ![Place cornell_box_full_lighting.png in student_outputs/final folder](student_outputs/final/cornell_box_full_lighting.png) |
| cornell_box_direct_lighting_only.ini |  ![](example-scenes/ground_truth/final/cornell_box_direct_lighting_only.png) | ![Place cornell_box_direct_lighting_only.png in student_outputs/final folder](student_outputs/final/cornell_box_direct_lighting_only.png) |
| cornell_box_full_lighting_low_probability.ini |  ![](example-scenes/ground_truth/final/cornell_box_full_lighting_low_probability.png) | ![Place cornell_box_full_lighting_low_probability.png in student_outputs/final folder](student_outputs/final/cornell_box_full_lighting_low_probability.png) |
| mirror.ini |  ![](example-scenes/ground_truth/final/mirror.png) | ![Place mirror.png in student_outputs/final folder](student_outputs/final/mirror.png) |
| glossy.ini |  ![](example-scenes/ground_truth/final/glossy.png) | ![Place glossy.png in student_outputs/final folder](student_outputs/final/glossy.png) |
| refraction.ini |  ![](example-scenes/ground_truth/final/refraction.png) | ![Place refraction.png in student_outputs/final folder](student_outputs/final/refraction.png) |

> Note: The reference images above were produced using the [Extended Reinhard](https://64.github.io/tonemapping/#extended-reinhard) tone mapping function with minor gamma correction. You may choose to use another mapping function or omit gamma correction.

### Design Choices
Please list all the features your path tracer implements.

### Extra Features
