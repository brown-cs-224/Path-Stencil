## Path (final)

Please fill this out and submit your work to Gradescope by the deadline.

### Output Comparison
Run the program with the specified `.ini` config file to compare your output against the reference images. The program should automatically save to the correct path for the images to appear below.

Note that your outputs do **not** need to exactly match the reference outputs. There are several factors that may result in minor differences, such as your choice of tone mapping and randomness.

> If your program can't find certain files or you aren't seeing your output images appear, make sure to:<br/>
> 1. Set your working directory to the project directory
> 2. Set the command-line argument in Qt Creator to `template_inis/intersect/<ini_file_name>.ini`

> Note: Please do not attempt to duplicate the given reference images; we have tools to detect this.
